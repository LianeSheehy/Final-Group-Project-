Pyhon: 

Python is a general purpose and high level programming language. You can use Python for developing desktop GUI applications, 
websites and web applications. Also, Python, as a high level programming language, allows you to focus on core functionality 
of the application by taking care of common programming tasks.

R: R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language 
and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. 
R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs
unaltered under R.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis,
classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice
for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.

One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical 
symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, 
but the user retains full control.

R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code 
form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.

HTML: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms 
may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics 
for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written 
using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> 
surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the 
HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web 
pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of 
the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997


Django: Django is an open-source framework for backend web applications based on Python — one of the top web development languages.
Its main goals are simplicity, flexibility, reliability, and scalability. Django has its own naming system for all functions 
and components (e.g., HTTP responses are called “views”).

Visual Studio: It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual 
Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, 
Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight.

Microsoft SQL Server Management: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for managing any SQL 
infrastructure. Use SSMS to access, configure, manage, administer, and develop all components of SQL Server, Azure SQL 
Database, and SQL Data Warehouse. SSMS provides a single comprehensive utility that combines a broad group of graphical
tools with a number of rich script editors to provide access to SQL Server for developers and database administrators 
of all skill levels.

Microsoft Azure: At its core, Azure is a public cloud computing platform—with solutions including Infrastructure as a
Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) that can be used for services such as 
analytics, virtual computing, storage, networking, and much more.

Github: It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task 
management, and wikis for every project. GitHub offers plans for free, professional, and enterprise accounts. Free 
GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open source projects.

ZenHub: ZenHub is a beta product that allows us to develop faster, communicate better, and release without 
overhead by integrating everything within GitHub, the place all our code lives in.

Zenhub is an agile project management tool that is closely integrated with GitHub. In fact, it is so integrated that 
GiHub issues appear as issues on on the Zenhub project boards and vice versa. We (the JEDI team) are now using ZenHub 
to manage code development (including sprints), track issues, and promote collaboration.

Postman (REST Api): Postman is a powerful tool for performing integration testing with your API. It allows for repeatable, 
reliable tests that can be automated and used in a variety of environments and includes useful tools for persisting data and 
simulating how a user might actually be interacting with the system.
